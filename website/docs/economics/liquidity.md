Token has time value and can generate income from token.

Because the storage cost and transaction risk will make your blockchain assets volatile, if there is no natural interest rate mechanism to offset these costs, then the holding behavior of token will not be encouraged.

We hope that bool holders can benefit from the liquidity of mapping token. Therefore, we will purchase the transaction fees of the bool from the mapping token users and distribute them to the users who hold the bool.

When users purchase bool in DEX or Swap, the smart contract will deduct 0.3% of bool as transaction fee, and the service charge will be accumulated in the smart contract. Any user can send a dividend request to the bool smart contract through DAPP or directly. At this time, the smart contract will pay dividends automatically according to the currency holding ratio of the bool, and the wallet address holding the bool will get the corresponding interest.
