The reward and slash mechanism plays an important role in the long-term operation of the whole system. Boolnetwork reward sources mainly include verifier reward, which includes two parts: block out and verification; nominator reward, which is supported by mortgage token; private key management reward, obtained by maintaining TSS node. Among them, verifier reward and nominator reward follow polkadot NPOS mechanism, and private key management reward is proportional to the number of private keys maintained. 

At the same time, it is necessary to punish dishonest nodes, including offline nodes and malicious nodes caused by network problems. When the system is available, honest nodes can jointly report untruthful nodes and punish them accordingly. In addition, individual nodes can be punished by the way of committee governance.
