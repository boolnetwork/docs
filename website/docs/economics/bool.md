## BOOL Network

|Unit            |Decimal Places|
|----------------|--------------|
|Planck          |1             |
|Microbol (uBOL) |4             |
|Millibol (mBOL) |7             |
|Bol (BOL)       |10            |

## What are the uses of BOL?

1. To be be staked for operation.

The NPos mechanism is consistent with Polkadot, and the benefits of the witness and the nominator are divided. The starting node can become the verifier, which can capture more revenue. It can also generate revenue when nominating other nodes to become verifier. NPos is an improved version of DPos, which solves the trend of centralization of verification programs. Nominators will automatically balance assignments among multiple verifiers to avoid Matthew effect.

NPos revenue reference https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-staking.

2. To be threshold node.

## Economic Stakeholders
* Validators: Provide the computational resource and security for the network by running nodes.
* Threshold Nodersï¼š Provide security for cross chain assets.
* Developers: Create the applications which run atop the network.
* Token Holders: Accounts or applications which maintain token balances.
* BOOL Foundation: An independent entity which coordinates the governance and technical evolution efforts of the network participants.
* Third Party Observers: The observers of the chain who provide extra fraud and bad behavior protection.
* Users: Users of applications on the network who do not maintain token balances.

The impact of economic policies on each of these stakeholders is examined below.
