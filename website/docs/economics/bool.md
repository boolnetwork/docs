## What are the uses of BOL?

1. To be be staked for operation.

The NPos mechanism is consistent with Polkadot, and the benefits of the witness and the nominator are divided. The starting node can become the verifier, which can capture more revenue. It can also generate revenue when nominating other nodes to become verifier. NPos is an improved version of DPos, which solves the trend of centralization of verification programs. Nominators will automatically balance assignments among multiple verifiers to avoid Matthew effect.

NPos revenue reference https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-staking.
