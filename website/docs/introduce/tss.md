At present, there are two main modes in the cross chain scheme: light node and multi sign. The multi signature mode can effectively avoid the problems of too centralized authority and the project side doing evil. However, the multi signature scheme needs the support of chain virtual machine, which requires high requirements for the chain signature algorithm and poor universality. The scalability of light node mode is seriously insufficient. When multi chain and cross chain are involved, light nodes of corresponding chains need to be realized. Therefore, we introduce a threshold signature protocol to remedy the above defects.
