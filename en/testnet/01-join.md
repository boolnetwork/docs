# Participate

Participate in the BOOLNetwork testnet and experience different cross-chain solutions.

---

BOOLNetwork is a decentralized, secure, and private full-chain interoperability network. The network is unrestricted, and anyone can build decentralized full-chain interoperability protocols such as cross-chain bridges on it, supporting the interconnection of full chains (such as heterogeneous chains and oracles) in a stable, efficient, and low-cost manner Cross-Border Sharing. As we all know, all full-chain interoperability behaviors can be simplified by one relay delivering one blockchain information (or off-chain data) to another blockchain, but secure and decentralized trusted relays are difficult to achieve. To solve this problem, we design a relay base network based on MPC, ZKP, and TEE technology. More specifically, the network provides a private dynamic committee mechanism to manage private keys, which is perfectly compatible with the core public and private key mechanism of mainstream blockchains, and uses BOOL's original Ring Verifiable Random Function (Ring VRF) election algorithm and P2P The network guarantees the privacy of committee members. At the same time, all committee programs run in the TEE, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of key components.

BOOL Network has four roles:

1. Full Nodes- Maintaining Block Stability;
2. Device providers - providing TEE equipment;
3. Cross-chain bridge providers - providing cross-chain bridge services;
4. Relayers - provides the target chain on-chain service in the cross-chain service;

## What wallet should I use?

The accounts of the BOOLNetwork are Ethereum compatible, so browsers with the Metamask plugin can quickly interact with the chain, referring to[wallet](/tools/wallet)ã€‚

## How do I get BOL?

The official [faucet](https://faucet.bool.network/)is provided to claim the testnet BOL for free. To claim the testnet BOL, you only need to enter the address created on wallets such as MetaMask, and we will not let you enter any other personal information. Please wait a few seconds after applying.
