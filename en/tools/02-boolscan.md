# Explorer

Get more information on blocks, accounts, transactions

---

A Explorer can be thought of as a search engine for the blockchain, allowing users to search for information such as balances, blocks, and transactions.

## BoolScan

[BoolScan](http://boolscan.com/) is an official cross-chain blockchain browser that integrates functions such as Facility Management, committee management, and cross-chain bridge management, and also supports cross-chain transaction queries. Currently, only the MetaMask wallet is supported, allowing users to interact with the chain in BoolScan.

## Polkadot.js

[Polkadot.js Apps](https://apps.bool.network/) is not a full-featured blockchain browser, but it is very convenient for developers, especially for running a local node, to view the status of the node. The app uses a WebSocket endpoint to interact with the network. You can easily connect to BOOLNetwork, the default port is `9944` .
