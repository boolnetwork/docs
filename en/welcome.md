# Getting Started Guide

The vision of BOOLNetwork is to connect everything, build a trusted network across the world for Web3, and be the TCP/IP protocol of Web3.

---

[BOOLNetwork](https://bool.network/) is an open, distributed, and secure data notary platform. It is the LayerBase infrastructure, which solves the pain points of the existing notary cross-chain facilities such as insufficient openness (decentralization), relatively high operational threshold, and inability to call cross-chain contracts. BOOLNetwork is the LayerBase infrastructure that supports heterogeneous cross-chain interoperability, and oracle at the same time.
