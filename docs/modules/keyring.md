If you want to join TSS management, participants need to mortgage more than the total value of the maintenance assets. At the same time, the participant publishes the public key on the chain, and the relay chain collects all the signature data of TSS nodes for punishment and reward. When signature is needed, t participants are selected randomly in the relay chain. The exit mechanism of TSS is to redeem the deposit when applying for exit. It needs N cycles to arrive at the account, regenerate the shared private key, and transfer assets (if the sub chain supports smart contracts, the owner can be updated in the smart contract). The exit mechanism can only be managed by the committee, and the TSS node cannot join or exit at will.
